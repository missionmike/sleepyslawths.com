Growing up, Michael Dinerstein was one of those kids who would take things apart and put them back
together just to see how they “ticked.” Understanding the basics was never enough. His interests
weren’t just technical though, they were also creative. Playing guitar at church services led to
learning about live sound. When his parents got a PC in the mid-90s his curiosity led him to learn
the computer’s inner-workings. While learning Microsoft BASIC, his first bit of code was, not
surprisingly, a program that generated tones to play a melody.

After high school, Mike set his sights on pursuing something that would enable him to utilize both
his artistic and technical inclinations. This ultimately led to Web Design & Development. This
career path allowed him to incorporate his creative eye with a love of programming, analytical
thinking, and learning.

Michael has been married to his lovely wife Yohana since 2012. They have four beautiful children.
He’s looking forward to seeing if his kids might also want to know how things “tick.”
